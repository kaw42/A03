How to use Git and Github:

1.)install git as a local program and make a github account

2.)open webstorm and connect github to git by opening system preferences, selecting version control, then git, and entering the path to the git.exe

3.)in github, create the plus sign on the upper right corner to create a repository

4.)when setting up the repository, make it public and add the readme file

5.)to create a repository from webstorm, select VCS and import into version control

6.)to import a repository from github, enter the URL from github

7.)you can also create a webstorm file by going from Choose File to HTML, then to HTML 5 File, and then Stylesheet

8.)to add files to Git, when the Add to Git dialog opens, click Add.This will add to the local file system

9.)finally, commit your changes and push to remote repository

10.)after all of this, you should have the files on github

Glossary:
* **Branch:** shows the branches made from Master which are being worked on locally
* **Clone:** creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the codes, project’s files, history, and branches
* **Commit:** saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process
* **Fetch:** allows you download files and changes from the remote to your local repository
* **GIT:** a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
* **Github:** a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions) and pull requests a code for review
* **Merge:** Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request
* **Merge Conflict:** Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.
* **Push:** updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch
* **Pull:** updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart
* **Remote:** This is the common repository all team members used to exchange their changes. The Remote repository should be most updated version of the code repository
* **Repository:** a place or a container where something is stored
